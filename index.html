            <h1 style="color:goldenrod;">Bonalu</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color:blueviolet;">Bonalu is a vibrant and deeply rooted festival of Telangana, dedicated to Goddess Mahakali and celebrated with great fervor, especially in Hyderabad and Secunderabad. Observed during the Hindu month of Ashada Masam (June–July), the festival’s name comes from the Telugu word ‘Bonam’, meaning meal, symbolizing the food offerings made to the goddess as a mark of gratitude and thanksgiving. Women prepare rice cooked with milk and jaggery in new brass or earthen pots, adorned with neem leaves, turmeric, vermilion, and a lit lamp, which they carry on their heads in colorful processions to local temples. The origins of Bonalu trace back to the 19th century, when people began offering thanks to the goddess for protection from a deadly plague. The festival is marked by elaborate rituals, special poojas, traditional music, dance, and community gatherings, reflecting Telangana’s rich cultural heritage and the collective spirit of devotion and unity</p>
